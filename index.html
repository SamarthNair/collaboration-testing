	Hello... this is a line by SamarthNair
	<br>
	Mention your username or some indication as to who modified it in any of the lines you modify for testing purposes.
	<br>
	Make branches of your own to modify.
	<br>
	Help me do the two common types of situations faced while collaborating: 
<p style="padding: 5px;">
	<ul>
		<li>Make changes and pull repo before committing to main branch. In that way any changes made to the repo since the last time you pulled would be reflected in the local version you have</li>
		<li>Same as above but dont pull before commiting which will cause the repo to be overwritten and any changes made would be gone(worst case scenario)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<br>
<b>(PS: I dont really know about any other major condition, so bata dena kuch aur krne se pehle)</b>
